# compchem-portfolio
Portfolio of code I've written for computational chemistry projects through classwork, research, and out of personal curiosity.

I mostly use Python and its constituent libraries for task automation, input file generation for other compchem codes (e.g. LAMMPS), analyzing and plotting output files, and so on. I also use it for other visualizations. For some implementations that require faster code, I use Fortran.

Among specific compchem codes, I most frequently use LAMMPS, and occasionally Gromacs, for classical MD simulations. I'm currently learning Quantum Espresso for DFT calculations and AIMD simulations.
